# hello-world
Basic intro projects that I'll be displaying here.

Also since I wasn't able to put my entire intro in the intro section. This will suffice.

Hello everyone, my name is currently 0Clappie, but you can go ahead and ignore that. I'm more commonly known as dolphin and even more
commonly known as ultrakill6700k and I own a 980ti and ironically enough, a 6700k. I'm an ambitious young man that's approximately twenty-
four years of age. Even though we just met, I don't wanna be weird by taking things too fast, but if I could just get a short list of
things that'll make you smile, in tandem with your telephone number and/or snapchat. We can take this relationship and propel it to the
next level.
